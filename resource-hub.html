        <h2>Mindful Shopping</h2>
        <p>
            If shopping feels like it's taking over your life, we want you to know you're not alone and you've already taken the first step by landing here. This space is all about helping you learn to regain control, find balance, and feel good about your choices again.
            We've gathered tips, tools, and resources to help you rid the stress and start building healthier shopping habits. Whether you're here to tackle some splurges or just want a little guidance, you'll find support every step of the way!
            Let's kick those compulsive shopping habits to the curb and make room for more of what truly brings you joy. You've got this—and we've got your back! 
        </p>

        <p>
            Healthy shopping habits are valuable because they help you stay in control of your finances, avoid unnecessary debt, and focus on what truly matters to you. 
            Learning to shop mindfully not only reduces anxiety but also creates a sense of empowerment, as you make intentional choices that align with your goals. 
            Financial literacy is just as important—at every age! Understanding how to budget, save, and spend wisely sets you up for long-term stability and freedom. 
            Whether you're planning for a new home, tackling student loans, or simply looking for peace of mind, these skills are the foundation for achieving your goals and living a life that feels secure and balanced.
        </p>    
            <p>There are some important questions you can ask yourself before beginning shopping:</p>
        
            <ol type=1>
                <li>Is there something that's triggering me to shop? Stress, boredom, or anxiety can cause your mind to search out ways to gain some quick happiness. 
                    If you're feeling any of these, you may want to take a few breaths and engage in a different activity.</li>
                <li>Do I really need this right now? A common tip is to leave the item for 24 hours and if you've forgotten about it, then you probably don't need it - You can also add items to a wishlist instead!</li>
                <li>How many emails or texts have I recently received about a sale or new item? Companies love to send you promotions or notices about products going on sale. It's a trap! Consider unsubscribing from their communications to keep it off your mind.</li>
                <li>Have I set any limits for myself? It can be easy to spend and purchase when you aren't holding yourself accountable, but those things add up! Further down this page, we talk about setting up a budget that helps you create boundaries to how much you can and have to spend. </li>
            </ol>

        <h2>Budgeting and Saving</h2>
            <p>Budgeting and saving are the cornerstones of financial stability. A good budget helps you track your income and expenses, ensuring you're in control of where your money goes and can recall where it went. 
            Saving allows you to prepare for the future, whether it's an emergency fund, a big purchase, or long-term goals like retirement.
            An important way of accomplishing this is by setting up a budget! A budget is essentially a plan for how you'll use your monthly income. 
            By taking the total of your earnings for the month and figuring out the essential bills you need to pay for, you can see how much remaining income you have to put towards savings or 'wants'. 
            </p>
            <p>A good way to start is by creating a list of expenses that are recurring, such as:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                    <li>Auto payments (car loans, car insurance, gas)</li>
                    <li>Home payments (mortgage, rent, home insurance, property tax)</li>
                    <li>Utilities (electric, heating, water)</li>
                    <li>Debt (loan payments, credit card payments)</li>
                    <li>Other (childcare, telephone, health insurance, pet care)</li>
                 </ul>
            <p>Calculate the total, then take a look at your pay stub and see your total income after taxes. Subtracting your expenses total from that number will give you your remaining amount. 
                (We have also include links at the bottom that provide free spreadsheets if you need guidance)
                You should plan to take a percentage of that and put it towards a savings account. Savings are important for when unexpected events happen! Like your car breaks down or your basement floods, because even if insurance covers a majority of the bill, your copay can still end up being hundreds of dollars. 
            </p>
            <p>This is preparing for the short term and paying yourself! However, savings also give you something to look forward to! If you're looking to purchase a home, for example, you can start saving for the down payment. There are a couple ways you can build savings: 
                You can set up an automatic transfer after each paycheck to put a certain amount into that savings account that way you don't have to think about it, or you can download an app that tracks how much you put into savings. 
                After all that, then you can allocate some money for the 'wants' because those are important too. Which is why you plan, to make sure you don't spend outside of your budget.
            </p>
