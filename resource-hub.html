            Let's kick those compulsive shopping habits to the curb and make room for more of what truly brings you joy. You've got this—and we've got your back! 
        </p>
        <p>
            Healthy shopping habits are valuable because they help you stay in control of your finances, avoid unnecessary debt, and focus on what truly matters to you. Learning to shop mindfully not only reduces anxiety but also creates a sense of empowerment, as you make intentional choices that align with your goals. 
            Financial literacy is just as important—at every age! Understanding how to budget, save, and spend wisely sets you up for long-term stability and freedom. Whether you're planning for a new home, tackling student loans, or simply looking for peace of mind, these skills are the foundation for achieving your goals and living a life that feels secure and balanced.
            There are some important questions you can ask yourself before beginning shopping:
        </p>
        <p>
            <ol type=1>
                <li>Is there something that's triggering me to shop? Stress, boredom, or anxiety can cause your mind to search out ways to gain some quick happiness. 
                    If you're feeling any of these, you may want to take a few breaths and engage in a different activity.</li>
                <li>Do I really need this right now? A common tip is to leave the item for 24 hours and if you've forgotten about it, then you probably don't need it - You can also add items to a wishlist instead!</li>
                <li>How many emails or texts have I recently received about a sale or new item? Companies love to send you promotions or notices about products going on sale. It's a trap! Consider unsubscribing from their communications to keep it off your mind.</li>
                <li>Have I set any limits for myself? It can be easy to spend and purchase when you aren't holding yourself accountable, but those things add up! Further down this page, we talk about setting up a budget that helps you create boundaries to how much you can and have to spend. </li>
            </ol>
