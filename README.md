ALSO -- it's not looking right on mobile yet!! Ah! OH and I want to make a favicon...

NOTES based on the project desc on Canvas:
- we need to add bylines on each page describing who wrote what content etc 
- I added an about section on the home page left nav so we can add little bios
- we definitley need to run everything through the html & css validators that we used for the web basics project

here's our proposal doc for reference: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ppxQhMP8yJGQW6aQ1pEW5KUd-W9hwDORLo-pTayLqUI/edit?usp=sharing
