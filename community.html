        <h2>How to Buy Less and Choose Well!</h2>
        <h3>Quick Tips</h3>
        <p>First, you must find or create a realistic buy less strategy</p>
        <p>Secondly, only buy items that you can envision yourself using for multiple years and occasions</p>
        <p>Lastly, categorize items as wants or a need</p>

        <p>We understand! Online shopping makes life so convenient, but it's easy to overspend when everything is just a click away. 
            Mindful, smart online shopping habits help you get what you need (and occasionally want) without buyer's remorse or blowing your budget.
            By learning to plan ahead, spot good deals, and avoid sneaky marketing traps, you can shop with confidence and stay in control. <br>These are some guides to shop responsibly as you're learning to break some tough habits:</p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Learn about sellers and their products
                A good strategy before making any purchase is to read customer services about the product from 
                a wide variety of sites. Consider where the review is posted, how long ago it was posted, and who wrote it. Star ratings aren't always telling of the whole truth and they may be misleading.</li>
                <li>Check the store or seller's return polices 
                There are laws requiring items to be shipped as described and within a certain timeframe! Find 
                out whether their return policy includes refunds: How long do you have to return the item? Does it have to be unopened? Who pays for shipping fees? Do discounted items fall under the policy?</li>
                <li>Use a credit card when possible
                Credit cards allow you to protect yourself in the event of a fraudulent purchase or scam. If you notice a discrepancy in your bill, you are able to dispute the charge and your credit card company 
                will investigate the situation to ensure you keep your money safe. Basically it means if you see an incorrect charge or you were charged but never got your purchase, you can get in contact with the 
                credit company to help you get a refund or cancel the charge. But it's important to do this as soon as you notice!</li>
                <li>Keep records
                You never know when you'll need specific information on what you've bought, so keep track of: 
                the company or seller's name and website, what you ordered, when you ordered it, what you paid, any return policies, the company or seller's promise to ship your order, the date they promised to ship it by, 
                any emails or communications with the seller, and your bank statements that show how much you paid.</li>
                <li>Be aware of the absolute no-nos 
                Never purchase and pay by way of gift cards, it's a common way scammers gain untraceable money. Never store your credit card information, it may be accessible by others. Don't use the 
                same username and password across multiple store accounts, if one gets hacked, the rest are vulnerable. Never give away more personal information than necessary, a store will never need your social security number!</li>
            </ol>
        <p>Always trust your gut! If something seems suspicious or you're having doubts about that 85% final sale, it's okay to not purchase, better to keep looking than to risk your personal information or money being stolen.</p>
